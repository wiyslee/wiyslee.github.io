title: 'Understanding the DDH ultrasound'
excerpt: Visualizing and drawing the anatomy behind the hip ultrasound for developmental dysplasia of the hip.

I have previously been quite perplexed by the hip ultrasound for Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH). I look at the image, draw a few lines, make a few measurements, and come to a conclusion... but <b><i>what did I really measure and what does it really mean?</i></b>

Let us start by looking at the <b>acetabulum</b> itself. The acetabulum forms the "socket" for the "ball-and-socket" joint of the hip, with the femoral head providing the "ball" portion. The acetabulum itself is formed at the juncture of three bones of the pelvis - <b>the ilium, ischium, and pubis</b>. These come together to form a "Y"-shape epiphyseal (growth) plate called the <b>triradiate cartilage</b> which closes at around 12-14 years of age (later for boys than girls).

    <br>(Blue = Ilium; Green = Ischium; Red = Pubis; Purple = Triradiate cartilage)</center></figcaption>
</figure>

The circle region above delineates the socket and in it, the femoral head is (ideally) snugly head in place. Here there is a non-osseous player that helps with the attachment - the <b>labrum</b>. The labrum is a circular ring of cartilage that attaches to the acetabulum, essentially creating a soft lining for the edge of the socket. (It is often associated with tears, but that is a story for another day.)

</figure>

But what happens in DDH? The socket is too shallow for proper placement of the femur, causing an increased propensity toward hip subluxation and dislocation. For infants suspected of having DDH (either from physical exam or high risk factors), an <b>ultrasound</b> can be performed to assess the hip joint. The ultrasound is taken in the coronal view, which is the same view as the images above. One can see that the images below are equivalent to the above view with a 90 degree counter-clockwise rotation.

</figure>

From this ultrasound, we then can measure the depth of the socket by measuring the angle that the ilium makes as it turns to make the acetabular roof. The larger this angle is, the deeper the socket is for the femoral head to sit in, creating a more stable hip joint. We call this the <b>alpha angle</b> and a normal hip has an alpha angle of <b>greater than 60 degrees</b>.

The other angle that we measure is between the labrum and the ilium, which we call the <b>beta angle</b>. This angle represents the amount of the head that lies outside or lateral to the socket. We look for an angle <b>less than 55 degrees</b> in a normal hip.

Hopefully that helped to visualize the anatomy of the hip and understand why we measure the angles we do!
