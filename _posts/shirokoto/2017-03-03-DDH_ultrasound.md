excerpt: Visualizing and drawing the anatomy behind the hip ultrasound for developmental dysplasia of the hip.

I have previously been quite perplexed by the hip ultrasound for Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH). I look at the image, draw a few lines, make a few measurements, and come to a conclusion... but <b><i>what did I really measure and what does it really mean?</i></b>

Let us start by looking at the <b>acetabulum</b> itself. The acetabulum forms the "socket" for the "ball-and-socket" joint of the hip, with the femoral head providing the "ball" portion. The acetabulum itself is formed at the juncture of three bones of the pelvis - <b>the ilium, ischium, and pubis</b>. These come together to form a "Y"-shape epiphyseal (growth) plate called the <b>triradiate cartilage</b> which closes at around 12-14 years of age (later for boys than girls).
