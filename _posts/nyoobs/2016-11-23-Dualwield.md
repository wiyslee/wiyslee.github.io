Imagine a flurry of blades slicing everything at the heart of Lijiang Tower's garden, the blades' owner moving so fast (think epic anime fight scene here) that the eye can't keep up. For a few, fleeting, beautiful seconds, the *Bladedancer* is effectively invincible, though perhaps not technically so, through his sheer martial prowess and speed.

That's what we envision for a new, dual-wielding Overwatch hero, the *Bladedancer*, a Chinese martial artist using two swords (i.e. butterfly swords) to cut through his enemies. Like a Reinhardt or *Ryujin no...!*, the Bladedancer will be a strictly melee class, using high mobility and "dashing" abilities to get his enemies within range and slice them to ribbons. 

While Overwatch has made a number of innovations to the arena/FPS genre, with a number of heroes sporting entirely novel abilities and playing styles (think Mei, Genji, D.Va), we thought that there would still be a place in our (and probably every anime or gaming fan's) hearts for a hero that would provide a punishing offensive through assassination while relying only on martial arts and melee abilities.

For such a hero, we envisioned the following set of skills:

* **Assassinate** (*E*): The Bladedancer instantly dashes ("teleports") behind the targeted enemy within a certain range (possibly with a mechanic alerting the enemy of his presence) and performs a powerful slash with both blades. Play continues as normal afterward; this skill should either finish off an enemy that is relatively low (perhaps around 50 health) or provide and engage for *Bladedance*. Otherwise, the Bladedancer will likely be caught in a difficult position and have little recourse but to try to dash out.

* **Bladedash** (*Shift*): Much like a Soldier 76's sprint, this skill allows the Bladedancer to sprint while moving and can be toggled on/off. Since the hero is entirely melee, unlike Soldier, we expect that Bladedash should enable faster movement than Soldier's sprinting. It will also be the one of the only ways for the Bladedancer to escape if Assassinate fails to kill the target (or the target was in the midst of many enemies), so enabling fast movement will be crucial.

* **Bladedance** (*Q*): The Bladedancer's ultimate is where he draws his name. Upon pressing *Q*, the Bladedancer flies into a flurry of dashes and slashes in a certain radius (somewhere between Zarya's and Mei's ultimates). The Bladedancer is invisible during this time (all other heroes see is a smoke-like flurry in this area) and randomly slashes an enemy within the Bladedance every given interval. (This would obviously combo well also with Zarya and Mei's ultimates, as well as others that render the enemy immobile, such as Reinhardt's.)

* **Slash** (*Right/left click*): Finally, the Bladedancer's regular attacks will be melee. Since he has two blades, he will be using each of them with right or left click, each with its own set attack speed. The player can choose to alternate clicks for continuous damage or activate them both at once for a larger burst. It would be interesting to add small bonus damage for the latter (both blades at once), i.e. 20 health each and 50 health together.
